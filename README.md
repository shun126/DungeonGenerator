# Dungeon generator plugin for Unreal Engine

![DungeonGeneratorPlugin](Document/DungeonGenerator03.jpg)

One day I wanted to create a video game, but I didn't have the level design know-how. So I decided to create a procedural dungeon generator.
The dungeon generator was based on Vazgriz's algorithm. You can read more about [Vazgriz's algorithm here](https://vazgriz.com/119/procedurally-generated-dungeons/).

This is an easy to use. Simply drop the DungeonGenerateActor into your level, set the grid scale and number of rooms and start generating out your structures. 

Please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/shun126/DungeonGenerator/wiki) for more information.
